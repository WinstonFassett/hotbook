# Handoff — Hierarchical Chart Feedback & Next Plan

## Session context

Branch: `feat/gesture-transition-contract`. Phases 1-6 of the hierarchical overhaul are complete (8 commits). All 12 Playwright tests passing. Status doc updated at `wiki/2026-07-18-hierarchical-overhaul-status.md`.

Dev servers: `hotbook-demos.localhost:1355` (demos) + `icicle-harness.localhost:1355` (harness). Both via portless.

## Winston's feedback (reviewed demos page, 2026-07-18)

### Round 2 feedback (slow-motion animation review, 2026-07-18)

**5. Treemap drill transition is fundamentally wrong.** When drilling into a node (e.g. "tech", the blue top-level node):
   - The "tech" node itself **shrinks into the upper-left corner** until it vanishes. This is backwards — tech is the container of the things filling the screen, so it should GROW and get pushed off-screen as its children take over.
   - The other root-level siblings **also scale down into the upper-left corner**. What they should do is slide DOWN (or in the appropriate direction), preserving separation, using offsets to push off-screen.
   - Labels vanish during the animation-out but reappear on pop-out (weird).
   - **Root cause:** `computeTreemapLayout` runs d3.treemap on the **effective root only** (drill target). The drill target's children get fresh layout filling [0,0,W,H], but the drill target itself + its siblings get NO layout entry → fall back to `{x:0,y:0,width:0,height:0}` → shrink to corner. This is NOT the D3 zoomable-treemap pattern.
   - **Fix:** mirror icicle's `computeLayout` — run d3.treemap on the FULL tree, then apply a 2D affine transform (scale + translate) that maps the focus node's rect → [0,0,W,H]. Off-subtree nodes scale up and translate off-screen, sliding there via CSS transitions. Icicle's transitions are the gold standard.
   - Reference: D3 zoomable treemap pattern. Production treemap (`packages/bireactive/src/charts/treemap.ts`) wraps the same `TreemapChart` — same bug. LayerChart inspo (`inspo/layerchart-treemap-sample.tsx`) is a static treemap, no drill transition to reference.

**6. Sunburst transitions are also not right.** Icicle transitions are wonderful and set the bar; sunburst needs to match. Need to study the D3 zoomable-sunburst example more carefully. (Also still has regression #3 below — center color fades to black on drill.)

**7. Circle pack still not zooming at all, still no breadcrumb.** (Same as regressions #1 + #4 below — confirmed still open.)

### Round 3 feedback (visual separation + layout, 2026-07-18)

**17. Breadcrumb space reservation** — when breadcrumb is enabled, it currently appears/disappears dynamically, causing a layout jump when drilling in (chart resizes to accommodate the breadcrumb bar, then transitions). Fix: if `showBreadcrumb` is enabled, always reserve the breadcrumb bar's space (even at root level when no breadcrumb shows). The chart area stays constant; the breadcrumb bar is either populated or empty but always takes the same height.

**18. Hierarchical family layout** — rearrange the 4-chart grid to 5 charts in a neat rectangle:
   - Left column: icicle (full height)
   - Center column: pack (top) + sunburst (bottom) — these fit in one column due to their dimensions
   - Right column: treemap (full height)
   - This makes it easy to compare visual/separation styles across all 4 hierarchical SVG charts + treetable.

**19. Inner padding / separation standardization** (extends #10-12 above with more specificity):
   - Icicle has the nicest separation — nothing nested inside, gaps are clean.
   - Sunburst could have just as good separation as icicle. Needs a standard `paddingInner` (angular gap) that creates separation between top-level groups (black shows through the gaps) and between nested levels (parent color shows through).
   - At nested levels, the gap shows the parent's color, not black. This raises a design question: **hairline borders** on nested slices/arcs/circles would give better visual distinction between levels. LayerChart uses `hsl(fill).darker(1)` for stroke.
   - Treemap: top-level separation is good, but nested blocks go flush against their container edges. Need `paddingOuter` (gap between parent edge and children) matching the separation amount, so nested blocks don't look like they're touching the container wall.
   - Standardize one `paddingInner` value across all hierarchical charts for consistent separation feel.

### Round 1 regressions (fix first)

1. **Pack not transitioning** — likely caused by Phase 3/4 changes (`exitFade` default, `_transitionOpts()` extraction). Pack drill has no transition animation at all. Investigate `pack-chart.ts` `_setupRendering` + `_transitionOpts()` + the `transitionOnUpdated` behavior wiring. **Root cause found:** pack never wired `withExitDelay` (unlike sunburst), so exiting circles are evicted immediately — the opacity CSS transition fires but is invisible. Also pack uses the same "recompute on effective root" pattern as treemap (see #5 above) — needs the same D3-style affine transform fix.

2. **Bar chart sort regression** — change sort to "order by value", edit a bar, release → bars animate back to original sort order instead of staying sorted by value. Probably a `frozenOrder` issue in `_composeStandardBehaviors` or the bar chart's own sort logic. Check `bar-chart.ts` + `behaviors/preview-full-render.ts`.

3. **Sunburst center color fades to black on drill** — when you drill into a colored node (e.g. red "health"), the center circle briefly shows the drilled color then fades/blinks back to black. The center should STAY the color of the drilled node — that's the current context. Check `sunburst-chart.ts` + `radial-geometry.ts` `makeArc` — the center circle's fill is probably static (root node color) instead of reactive to `drillId`.

4. **Pack has no breadcrumb / no way to drill out** — the base class has breadcrumb wiring but pack may not be calling it, or the demo isn't enabling it. User gets stuck after drilling in. Check `pack-chart.ts` — does it call `_composeStandardBehaviors` which includes breadcrumb? Is the demo config enabling breadcrumb?

### Demos page reorganization

5. **Sticky table of contents** — left sidebar TOC when width allows, hamburger menu when not (mobile can come later). Should list all demo sections, click to scroll.

6. **Section reordering** — things in better shape go higher, things in worse shape go lower:
   - **Top (tier 1)**: Hierarchical charts (icicle, sunburst, treemap, pack, treetable) — these are what Winston cares about most
   - **Middle**: Line chart, area chart, bar chart, scatter chart (Cartesian family)
   - **Novelty**: Radar, concentric arc, gauge, gauge-segmented
   - **Under construction / bottom**: Pie chart (not usable — see below), sankey, sankey-flow, tree-chart, budget-tree, gantt
   - **Bottom (experimental)**: Cartesian viewer (better shape), the other viewer (worse shape — not animating, overflow issues, no scrollbars)

### Hierarchical label overhaul

7. **Label color: black/near-black text** — white text gets washed out on the oklch color palette (especially lighter colors). Use near-black as default label color on all hierarchical charts. Budget tree already does this and looks good.

8. **Two-line label format** — name on first line (bold), value on second line (lighter weight). Budget tree has this pattern. Apply to:
   - Pack (circles — currently shows name only, no value)
   - Treemap (currently shows name only)
   - Icicle (currently shows no values — should add them)
   - Format the value appropriately (dollar amount, etc.)

9. **Root node label** — when drilled, show the root/context node as a labeled bar (like budget tree's "Portfolio $X"). Icicle should do this too. Proposed: render root node as labeled context when drilled, hide at top level.

### Separation / padding as config

10. **Configurable separation** — the gap between tiles/arcs/circles should be a config field, not hard-coded. LayerChart exposes:
    - `paddingInner` (gap between siblings — this is the "separation")
    - `paddingOuter` (gap between parent edge and children)
    - `paddingTop/Bottom/Left/Right` (per-side)
    - These map to d3-hierarchy's `treemap().padding*()` API
    
    Winston wants the separation to be consistent across charts that have the concept (treemap, icicle, pack, sunburst). The dividers/borders live in the center of the separation. Should also be a tweak (live-adjustable).

11. **Sunburst needs separation + borders** — currently no gap between arcs, handles look weird (thick, translucent). Adding `paddingInner` (angular gap) + hairline borders would fix this.

12. **Hairline border as config** — treemap has borders, sunburst doesn't. Make border style/thickness/color a config property. LayerChart uses `hsl(fill).darker(1)` for stroke color, `rx={5}` for rounded corners.

13. **Tile algorithm config** — LayerChart exposes `tile` option (squarify, resquarify, binary, dice, slice, sliceDice). We currently hard-code squarify. Should be configurable.

### Pie chart

14. **Pie chart is not usable** — move to under-construction section. Long-term plan: adapt sunburst to act as a pie chart (one-level sunburst, no drill, same controls/interactions). Could be a config preset on sunburst or a thin `PieChart` subclass. Not a priority now.

### Viewers (experimental)

15. **Cartesian viewer** — cool that you can touch-zoom, but needs:
    - Touch pan-scroll (drag to scroll axes)
    - Pinch-zoom on touchpad
    - Scrolling should scroll the axes
    - Currently in better shape than the other viewer
    
16. **Other viewer** — not animating, overflow problems, no scrollbars. Move to very bottom. These will eventually become behaviors, not chart-specific code. The "viewport tween" language was factored out because it's not exactly what we mean. Defer fixing until behavior extraction discussion.

### Demo data

17. **More levels in demo data** — current demos are 2-3 levels. Need 4-5 level fixtures to properly test deep hierarchies. Some demos in the app (hotbook) have deeper data; bring that richness to the demos page.

### Other notes

18. **Sankey/sankey-flow** — move to under-construction. Winston wants them but they're not first tier.

19. **Tree-chart** — similar, under-construction.

20. **Budget-tree** — test thing for bireactive parity. Keep but mark as test/parity.

21. **Gantt** — more useful than sankey but still kludgy. Under-construction.

22. **Nested-layered** — proven out in another project, adapted here, basically works but has a weird unrelated treetable. Under-construction.

## D3 zoomable reference (fetched to `inspo/d3-zoomable/`)

Source: `inspo/d3-zoomable/zoomable-treemap.js`, `zoomable-sunburst.js`, `zoomable-icicle.js` (from `https://api.observablehq.com/@d3/zoomable-*.js`).

### Icicle (the gold standard — already matches)

- `d3.partition().size([height, (height+1)*width/3])` — **full tree laid out once**.
- On click: `focus = focus === p ? p.parent : p`, then compute `d.target` for EVERY node:
  - `x0: (d.x0 - p.x0) / (p.x1 - p.x0) * height` — affine on value axis (scale + translate)
  - `y0: d.y0 - p.y0` — depth shift (translate only, no scale on depth)
- Transition: `cell.transition().duration(750).attr("transform", d => translate(target.y0, target.x0))` + rect height tween + label opacity tween.
- **No clamp.** Off-subtree nodes get `x0/x1` outside `[0, height]` → slide off-canvas. This is why icicle feels right — siblings slide away, focus children slide in, all on one shared timeline.
- Our `computeLayout` already does this (1D affine on value axis). ✓

### Treemap (the fix target)

- Custom `tile` function: `d3.treemapBinary(node, 0, 0, width, height)` then rescale children: `child.x0 = x0 + child.x0/width * (x1-x0)` etc. — **affine during tiling**, so focus children fill the focus's rect.
- `d3.treemap().tile(tile)(hierarchy)` — full tree laid out once.
- Scales `x.domain([d.x0, d.x1]); y.domain([d.y0, d.y1])` map focus rect → `[0,W]×[0,H]`.
- **Transition = two-layer crossfade**: `zoomin` creates a NEW `<g>` on top with the focus's children (fades in), the OLD `<g>` transitions to `position(d.parent)` (slides/shrinks to where focus was in the old view) + fades out + removes. `zoomout` reverses (old on top fades out, new underneath).
- D3 renders ONE level at a time (focus.children only), so crossfade is the natural choice.
- **Our architecture renders ALL descendants (nested)**, so we have a better option: single-set + 2D affine (the icicle pattern extended to 2D). Lay out the full nested treemap once, then for each rect apply `scaleX = W/focusW, scaleY = H/focusH, translate = (-focusX*scaleX, -focusY*scaleY)`. Every node including focus siblings gets a target → they slide off-screen (downward if focus was at top, preserving separation). Focus children scale up from inside the focus's old rect → fill screen. CSS transitions on x/y/width/height animate the slide. This gives the icicle feel Winston wants, not the crossfade D3 uses.

### Sunburst (also needs work)

- `d3.partition().size([2π, height+1])` — full tree laid out once.
- `root.each(d => d.current = d)` — stores per-node current state.
- On click: compute `d.target` for EVERY node:
  - `x0: Math.max(0, Math.min(1, (d.x0 - p.x0) / (p.x1 - p.x0))) * 2π` — **CLAMPED to [0, 2π]**
  - `y0: Math.max(0, d.y0 - p.depth)` — clamped to ≥0
- Transition: `path.transition(t).tween("data", d => interpolate(d.current, d.target)).attrTween("d", d => () => arc(d.current))` — **interpolates `current → target` per frame** via `attrTween`, re-rendering the arc path each frame. The clamp makes off-subtree arcs collapse to slivers, but the smooth interpolation makes the collapse look like a smooth shrink, not a snap.
- `arcVisible(d)`: `d.y1 <= 3 && d.y0 >= 1 && d.x1 > d.x0` — visibility gate (2 rings at a time).
- **NO center colored disc in the D3 reference.** The center is a transparent `<circle>` with `datum(root)` for click-to-zoom-out. Winston's "center stays drilled color" is our own design choice — needs its own fix (don't crossfade the center; swap instantly or z-order it on top so the old root disc is never visible during the transition).
- Our `computeRadialLayout` already clamps (matching D3) and uses per-arc cells + `settleArcCells` RAF tween (analogous to `attrTween`). The clamp is correct for sunburst. The remaining issue is the center color crossfade (#3) + matching the feel of icicle's transitions.

### Key takeaway

The unifying pattern: **lay out the full tree once, compute a per-node target on drill, tween every node from current → target.** Icicle does this (1D affine, no clamp). Sunburst does this (angular affine + clamp + attrTween). Treemap should do this (2D affine, no clamp) — our nested-rendering architecture makes single-set + affine a better fit than D3's crossfade. Pack should do this (2D affine on circles).

## LayerChart inspo reference

File: `inspo/layerchart-treemap-sample.tsx` + `inspo/layerchart/packages/layerchart/src/lib/components/Treemap.svelte`

Key patterns to adopt:
- **Padding API**: `paddingInner` / `paddingOuter` / per-side — maps to d3-hierarchy
- **Label segments**: name (10px font-medium) + value (8px font-extralight), black text
- **Stroke**: `hsl(fill).darker(1)`, `strokeOpacity` varies by colorMode
- **Rounded corners**: `rx={5}`
- **Color modes**: children (parent/leaf opacity), depth (sequential), parent (ancestor hue + brightness)
- **Tile algorithm**: configurable (squarify, resquarify, binary, dice, slice, sliceDice)
- **Clip path**: `RectClipPath` for label overflow (we do this too)
- **Controls component**: separate config UI component bound to config state (our equivalent: tweaks panel / config schema)

## Proposed plan (next session)

### Phase A: Fix drill transitions (blockers — biggest wins)

The unifying root cause: treemap, pack, and sunburst all use a "recompute layout on the effective root (drill target)" pattern. This makes the drill target's children fill the screen but leaves everything else with no layout entry → shrink-to-corner. Icicle is the gold standard because it walks the FULL tree and applies a D3-style affine transform so off-subtree nodes slide off-canvas.

**A1. Treemap drill transition** (feedback #5) — `treemap-geometry.ts` `computeTreemapLayout`:
  - Run d3.treemap on the FULL `root` (not `effectiveRoot`), walking all descendants into the map.
  - If `drillId`, find the focus rect `[fx, fy, fw, fh]` and apply 2D affine: `scaleX = W/fw, scaleY = H/fh, translate = (-fx*scaleX, -fy*scaleY)` to every rect.
  - Result: focus node grows to fill screen → its children (nested inside) take over; siblings scale up + translate off-screen (e.g. downward) preserving relative layout. CSS transitions on x/y/width/height animate the slide.
  - This matches icicle's `computeLayout` drill transform (1D value-axis scale) extended to 2D.
  - **Focus-node rendering = config option** (Winston's call): like icicle's `showRoot` and like `showBreadcrumb`, treemap should expose a config flag (e.g. `showRoot` reused, or a treemap-specific `showFocusTile`) controlling whether the focus node renders as a visible tile during drill or is the invisible container. Default TBD — likely hidden (container) to match D3 zoomable-treemap, but consumer-configurable.

**A2. Pack drill transition** (feedback #7, regression #1) — `pack-geometry.ts` `computePackLayout`:
  - Same fix: run d3.pack on the FULL tree, apply 2D affine transform mapping focus circle → canvas. Off-subtree circles slide off-screen.
  - Also wire `withExitDelay` in `pack-chart.ts` `_setupRendering` (like sunburst) so exit fade is visible. Currently exiting circles are evicted immediately → opacity transition fires but is invisible.
  - Pack positions (cx/cy/r) change on every layout re-derivation — the `_transitionOpts` already excludes cx/cy/r from CSS transition (only opacity). The affine transform approach should make this work because circles move smoothly via the transform, not via re-derivation chasing. May need to revisit whether to CSS-transition cx/cy/r now that the layout is stable.

**A3. Sunburst drill transition** (feedback #6, regression #3) — `radial-geometry.ts`:
  - Study D3 zoomable-sunburst example. Current `computeRadialLayout` already walks the full tree + applies angular scaling, BUT clamps angles to [0, 2π] → off-subtree arcs collapse to slivers instead of sliding off. Icicle lets off-subtree nodes go off-canvas. Sunburst may need the same (no clamp, let arcs render outside [0, 2π]).
  - Center color bug (#3): the root arc (full disc, rIn=0) fades out via `withExitDelay` while the drilled node's arc fades in → crossfade through black background. Fix: the new center (drilled node) should appear instantly or the old root should persist until the new one is opaque (z-order / timing).

**A4. Pack breadcrumb** (regression #4) — `pack-chart.ts`:
  - Pack calls `_composeStandardBehaviors` (which doesn't include breadcrumb — breadcrumb is wired in `connectedCallback` via `_setupBreadcrumb`, gated on `config.showBreadcrumb === true`). Check the demo config sets `showBreadcrumb: true`. The base wiring is shared; pack inherits it automatically. Likely a demo config issue.

**A5. Bar chart sort** (regression #2) — `apps/demos/src/main.ts` — **FIXED (fully reactive)**:
  - **Root cause:** the demos page was entirely imperative — no `cell`/`derive`/`effect` imports, just a mutable `let config` + `addEventListener('hashchange')` + an `applySort` loop walking a `mounted[]` array. Two sort states (global `config.sort` vs per-chart selector) fought because every sort code path unconditionally used the global, clobbering per-chart overrides.
  - **Architectural principle added** to `wiki/chart-architecture.md` §"Core stance": **Config layering — global defaults, per-chart overrides win.** The chart's effective config is the per-chart setting if set, else the global default. The chart is the source of truth for its own effective config; the global bar is a default, not a hidden override.
  - **Fix (reactive):** `globalSort = cell<'index'|'value'>(readConfig().sort)`. Each chart gets `sortOverride = cell<'index'|'value'|null>(null)` + `effective = derive(() => override.value ?? globalSort.value)`. A `wireSort(el, treetable, model, kind)` effect per chart applies the effective sort to the chart + treetable whenever it changes. The per-chart selector writes to `override.value`; the global button writes the URL hash → `hashchange` → `globalSort.value`. No `applySort` loop, no `mounted[]` array, no `gesturecommit` re-apply reading a stale global. The `gesturecommit` handler now reads `chartSort(el).effective.value` (reactive) for the bar chart's post-commit re-feed.
  - **Bar chart itself is already reactive on sort** — it detects data-array id-sequence changes via `orderHash` and tweens positions. It just needs the data model to re-feed sorted data, which the `wireSort` effect does. No bar-chart code change needed.
  - **What was deleted:** `let config` (mutable global), `applySort()` (imperative loop), `effectiveSort()` (event-faking helper), `mounted[]` array, `updateSortLabel()`, the second `hashchange` handler that walked `mounted[]`. ~70 lines of imperative orchestration replaced by ~40 lines of reactive wiring.

### Phase B: Demos reorganization
5. Sticky TOC (left sidebar, hamburger on narrow)
6. Section reordering per Winston's tiers
7. Richer demo data (4-5 level fixtures)

### Phase C: Hierarchical label overhaul
8. Black/near-black label text on all hierarchical charts
9. Two-line label format (name bold + value light) on pack, treemap, icicle
10. Root node context label when drilled (icicle + sunburst)

### Phase D: Separation/padding config
11. Add `paddingInner` / `paddingOuter` to `ChartConfig`
12. Wire through schemas → bi-adapter → layout functions
13. Add to tweaks panel (live-adjustable)
14. Sunburst: angular gap + hairline borders
15. Border style/thickness/color as config

### Phase E: Pie chart disposition
16. Move pie to under-construction
17. (Deferred) Adapt sunburst as pie — config preset or thin subclass
